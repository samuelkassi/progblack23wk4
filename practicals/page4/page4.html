<h3> How has Computer Science helped benefit Communication?</h3>
<p> Computer Science has essentially enabled communication greatly by making it faster, more efficient, and more accessible in much more varied forms than before.</p>

<h1> Examples of Computer Science Benefiting Communication </h1>


<h2> Instant World-Wide Communication </h2>
<p> Utilizing tools such as gmail, messenging apps or social media apps you are now able to instantly message anyone in the world and even share images with them. This is all made possible with the use of computer science to develop these tools and release them to the public for free or little-to-no cost.</p>
