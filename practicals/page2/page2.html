    <h2>Robotics</h2>
    <p>Technology involving robots provide alot of value to healthcare in the modern era.
        Surgical assisatnce robots can be used to perfom surgeries which were previously considered very dangerous
        due to the risk of human error, but his risk in no longer present due to the ability of robots to perfom very precise 
        actions perfectly every time. Another application of robotics in medicine is to help people with limited mobility. For 
        example prosthetics can be given to amputees to simulate a real limb, and electric wheelchairs can give mobility to people who 
        are unable to walk.

    <h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
    <p>AI and its applications are very important today in healthcare. AI allows more accurate diagnoses
        to be made, for example it was shown that <a>AI was able to recognise skin cancer more effectkvely than experienced doctors</a>
        . This is signigicant for diseases like cance here the earlier the signs that the disease exists the more likely the chance that
        the patient will recover from the disease. Furthermore, AI could provide non-emergency help to people not seeking out immediate healthcare
        which would help with the issue of hospitals being full especially in the United Kingdom.

    <h2>Medical imaging</h2>
    <p>Very complex hardware is required to create X-ray images which are imperative
        in identifying structural damage to the body.
